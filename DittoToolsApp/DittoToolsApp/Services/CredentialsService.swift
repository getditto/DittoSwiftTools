/// Manages the active credentials for the application.
///
/// `CredentialsService` acts as the single source of truth for managing user or app credentials.
/// It provides a single public interface, `activeCredentials`, which allows:
/// - Retrieving credentials from memory or the Keychain.
/// - Setting or removing credentials and ensuring they are securely persisted in the Keychain.
///
/// The service ensures that credentials are securely managed without exposing internal details of
/// Keychain operations or authentication handling.
///
/// ### Key Features
/// - Retrieve credentials from memory or the Keychain transparently.
/// - Save or remove credentials securely in the Keychain.
/// - Encapsulation: Only `activeCredentials` is exposed to external components; all other operations are internal.
///
/// Example Usage:
/// ```swift
/// if let credentials = CredentialsService.shared.activeCredentials {
///     print("Loaded credentials: \(credentials)")
/// } else {
///     print("No active credentials found.")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Note: Setting `activeCredentials` to `nil` will clear the Keychain.

    // Shared Singleton Instance

    // Current active credentials
    private var storedCredentials: Credentials?
    
    /// The active credentials used by the app.
    ///
    /// This property retrieves or sets the currently active credentials.
    /// If no configuration is cached in memory (`storedCredentials`), it attempts
    /// to load credentials from the Keychain using the `authenticationDelegate`.
    ///
    /// Setting this property:
    /// - Saves the new configuration to the Keychain if a valid credentials object is provided.
    /// - Removes the credentials from the Keychain if `nil` is assigned.
    ///
    /// Retrieving this property:
    /// - Returns the cached credentials (`storedCredentials`) if available.
    /// - Loads and caches the credentials object from the Keychain if one exists.
    /// - Returns `nil` if no credentials are found.
    ///
    /// - Note: Clearing this property (setting it to `nil`) removes the associated
    ///   credentials from the Keychain.
    ///
    /// Example:
    /// ```swift
    /// if let credentials = CredentialsService.shared.activeCredentials {
    ///     print("Loaded credentials: \(credentials)")
    /// } else {
    ///     print("No active credentials found.")
    /// }
