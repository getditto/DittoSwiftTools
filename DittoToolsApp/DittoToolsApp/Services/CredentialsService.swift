    /// Setting this property:
    /// - Saves the new configuration to the Keychain if a valid credentials object is provided.
    /// - Removes the credentials from the Keychain if `nil` is assigned.

    /// Retrieving this property:
    /// - Returns the cached credentials (`storedCredentials`) if available.
    /// - Loads and caches the credentials object from the Keychain if one exists.
    /// - Returns `nil` if no credentials are found.

    ///   credentials from the Keychain.

    /// if let credentials = CredentialsService.shared.activeCredentials {
    ///     print("Loaded credentials: \(credentials)")
